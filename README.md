# 🚢 Bateau de Thésée

This project is a **one-day challenge** focused on simulating the **Ship of Theseus** paradox in Python. The goal is to explore the philosophical concept of identity and change through the simulation of a ship that has all its parts replaced over time. In this implementation, the challenge lies in determining when the identity of the ship has changed as parts are swapped out.
